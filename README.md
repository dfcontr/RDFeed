# RDFeed

This exercise has been developed to demonstrate the following features:

  - Web service integration
  - Local data storage
  - Adaptive layout for multiple screen sizes and orientations
  - Support for iOS 8+ versions

The development of this app involved the use of CoreData, Autolayout and some third party libraries such as Alamofire and DateTools. They were installed using Cocoapods.

In order to run this app, download the zip file of the project or clone the repository to your desktop. Additionally, make sure you have installed Cocoapods (https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).
